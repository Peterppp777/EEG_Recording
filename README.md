Arduino Library Credentials:
1. LSM6DS3 Library
The LSM6DS3 is a 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope sensor. The library for this sensor might be available through the Arduino Library Manager or directly from the manufacturer's or a third-party GitHub repository.

2. CircularBuffer Library
For the CircularBuffer library, follow the same steps as above. You will likely find a suitable circular buffer library in the Arduino Library Manager.

(Remember to replace the include with exact file location of the library)

3. NRF52_MBED_TimerInterrupt Library
This library is used for handling timer interrupts on NRF52 devices. You can search for it in the Arduino Library Manager. If it's unavailable there, you must find it on GitHub or another source, download it, and add it to your IDE.

4. Arduino_CRC32 Library
This library is used for calculating CRC32 checksums. As with the other libraries, first try to find it in the Arduino Library Manager. If it's not available, look for it on GitHub or another source, download the .zip, and add it to your IDE.
